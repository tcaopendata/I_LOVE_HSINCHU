Event goers. Contrary to some believes, event organizers are not posters of new online marketing channels, but established traditional channels: word of mouth, poster wall, digital signage, street marketing, social media. Specifically, cult event organizers need no new channels, but established channels. While for large event organizers, reach is king, so traditional channels are the obvious choice. New online channels have everything but reach: available at anytime and place, no expiration date for posts, immune to vandalism and bad weather, free from school regulation.
